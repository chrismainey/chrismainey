About me
================

I am Head Data Scientist for Birmingham and Solihull ICB, part of the UK National Health Service (NHS). I
have led analytical and data science teams at acute hospitals, ICBs and NHS England. I have experience 
in patient safety, public health/population health management, statistical and machine learning models,
clinical networks and acute trust informatics. 

I completed my PhD in applied statistics and machine learning at UCL in
2020, focussing on methods for analysing incident reporting data in the
NHS using multi-level models, Generalized Additive Models, tree and
random forest methods and natural language processing (NLP). I also have
a strong interest in training and teaching. I'm a fellow of 
the NHS-R community and member of their technical advisory group.

I’m particularly into `R`, but skilled in SQL and several other
languages. Skilling up in Python at the moment.
